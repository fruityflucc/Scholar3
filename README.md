Its is website that i designed for my team as a Hackathon project, which I have now coded into a website, It is a online library concept website that ditched the middle man out and allows writers to directly post and publish their own books.

## Usage

- help Writers publish their own books.
- Cuts out the middleman, leaving the writers paying less fee for their books.
- Easy for the readers to access hundreds of books at once at the same place.
- kind of like Netflix but for books.

## Screenshots
A very basic yet a good looking landing page.
